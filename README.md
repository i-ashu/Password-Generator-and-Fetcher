# Password-Generator-and-Fetcher
This is a python project and it's sole purpose is to create a password using random module where several chars are already present as an input and for fetching this password I've made another file which will use read operation to fetch it. 

This python script has dictionary as keeping password alongwith entered account name for better and organised to keep several account's password. I've also included a little encryption method to make the whole password file unreadable and can be fetched only by entering master password.
